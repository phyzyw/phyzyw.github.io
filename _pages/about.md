I received the B.S. degree in Applied Physics from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing China in 2020. Then I obtained the M.Phil. degree in Computer and Information Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China in 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Kaiming SHEN](https://kaimingshen.github.io/index.html). Currently, I'm working toward the Ph.D. in Physics in [Angstrom Group](https://angstrom.ust.hk/) at HKUST supervised by [Prof. Ding PAN](https://physics.ust.hk/eng/people_detail.php?pplcat=1&id=346). 

## Research Interests
My research interests encompass Optimization, Statistics, and Computational Physics. Recently, I have been investigating generative AI, with a particular focus on explicit probabilistic models such as normalizing flows.
